# GPS Assignment

The goal of this assignment was to establish the position and clock offset of a GPS receiver when given the positions of 4 satellites, 
as well as the times of flight of the signals to the receiver. These positions and times are stored in gps_data.txt.

The code is an implementation of the Newtonâ€“Raphson method to find the location of the receiver.

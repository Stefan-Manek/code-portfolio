# Code Portfolio

> A short portfolio containing examples of code that I have written for academic assignments or projects. Each folder contains example code written in Python
> and a README provide context on the assignment or project.

## Contents

Much of the code for coursework I have completed was required to be in .ipynb format. The contents of the individual directories are listed below:

#### Tuppersat Project

Current project to launch a small satellite and collect atmospheric data during launch. Code includes interfacing with various detectors to extract
atmospheric data, or a GPS receiver to track the position of the satellite.

#### Gamma Detector Lab

Project to characterise 4 different gamma-ray detectors. Analysis inlcudes fitting energy peaks from the emission spectra of various radioactive
elements and plotting calibration and resolution curves.

#### GPS Assignment

Assignment to calculate position given the coordinates and time of flight for 4 GPS satellites. An iterative 
Newton-Raphson algorithm is implemented to achieve the position.

#### Data Science

Two separate assignments from a Data Science in Python class taken last semester. One assignment focusing on 
retireving data from a an online API and conducting analysis on the data acquired. 

The second assignment focused on parsing a database of News articles from 2020 under separate categories and 
implementing binary and multi-class classification models using scikit-learn.

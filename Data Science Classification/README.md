## Data Science Classification Assignment

For this assignment, a database of sample news articles were provided in HTML and the details including the title,
a snippet from the article body, and the news category were scraped and stored.

scikit-learn modules were then used to build both a binary and multi-class classifier using a k-nearest-neighbour algorithm.
The performance of the model and the effect of different training set sizes are also investigated.
